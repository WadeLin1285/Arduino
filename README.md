-	**Computer Alert System**
> Commercial program for application of computer security and auto-power-control systems. Using [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) board and Ethernet shield to send the alert message to server. With end-stop sensor to detect the door-opened and buzzer device used as the alarm generator.  

-    **H2O2 Concentration Calculator**
> The calculator for translation of H2O2 mass fraction and temperature to the H2O2 concentration. Originally, we use [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) to develop, but in future, we will change to [Arduino NANO](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano).

-    **Noodle Machine**
> Commercial program for application of automatic noodle cooking machine. Using step-motors to add the ingredients and move container to the next stop for the next cooking step.

-	**Tutorial**
> Some tutorial materials for Arduino.
